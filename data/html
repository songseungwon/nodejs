<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank" title="html5-1 Specification">Hypertext Markup Language(<u>HTML</u>)</a> is the standard Markup language
               for <strong>creating web pages</strong> and web applications
               Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from 
               local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.
               HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally 
               included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

               With HTML constructs, images and other objects, 
               such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page.
               It provides a means to create structured documents 
               by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, 
               lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated 
               by tags, written using angle brackets.
